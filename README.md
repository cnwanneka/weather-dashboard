Weather-dashboard

Description:

This application shows the current weather forecast of a given city and also it's 5-day weather forecast.

When a user types in a city name in the search bar, they are able to see the city name, date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, humidity and the wind speed of that location.

The user is also able to see the weather conditions of the next five days for that city.

It was challenging and interesting having to design this application. I had some difficulties while designing the application and I got some tips and guidance from the teaching assistants.
